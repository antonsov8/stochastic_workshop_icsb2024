Go to [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and log-in with your Google account. Upload this file to Colab. Usually, Colab opens a pop-up to open notebooks. Choose the upload option and upload the file. Otherwise, to upload: File > Upload Notebook. Once the file open on Colab, follow the instructions given in the file. This uploaded file will get saved in the Colab Notebooks folder of your Google Drive.\n","\n","## Instructions on using this Jupyter Notebook with Julia code on Colab\n","1. This note book has codes written in Julia. You can execute the codes in a cell by clicking the \"Run\" button beside the cell or by clicking on the cell and press Ctrl+Enter.\n","\n","2. Colab does not support Julia by default. So we have to install Julia and relevant packages first. That is done in the first cell.\n","\n","3. Execute the cell (click on it and press Ctrl+Enter) to install Julia, IJulia and other packages. This takes a couple of minutes (even 10 to 15 minutes).\n","\n","4. Reload this page (press Ctrl+R, or ⌘+R, or the F5 key) and continue to the next section where we check the instalation.\n","\n","5. The code in the \"checking the instalation\" section may throw error. In that case: Go to Runtime > Change runtime type > Select Julia from the pull down menu of Runtime type. Now, once you are ready with Julia, check the instalation by running the `versioninfo()` command again.  If there is no error, proceed for the subsequent code blocks.\n","\n","_Notes_:\n","* If your Colab Runtime gets reset (e.g., due to inactivity), repeat steps 3 to 5.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#First step: Install Julia and its packages"],"metadata":{"id":"Vb-qiMgvltPT"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"GIeFXS0F0zww","outputId":"84336d85-9be3-4c28-fb9b-3d8337e1d588"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Installing Julia 1.11.1 on the current Colab Runtime...\n","2024-11-28 07:06:37 URL:https://storage.googleapis.com/julialang2/bin/linux/x64/1.11/julia-1.11.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz [254553793/254553793] -> \"/tmp/julia.tar.gz\" [1]\n","Installing Julia package IJulia...\n","Installing Julia package Random...\n"]}],"source":["# For Instalations\n","\n","%%shell\n","set -e\n","\n","#---------------------------------------------------#\n","JULIA_VERSION=\"1.11.1\" # any version ≥ 0.7.0\n","JULIA_PACKAGES=\"IJulia Random\"\n","JULIA_NUM_THREADS=2\n","#---------------------------------------------------#\n","\n","if [ -z `which julia` ];
