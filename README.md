# Workshop on Stochastic Processes in Biology, ICSB 2024, IIT Bombay
This repository has the Julia codes for the workshop "Stochastic Processes in Biology â€“ an Introductory Course".
We use Jupyter Notebook. You can run these codes two ways - a) on your computer or b) on Google Colab. 

A. To run simulations on your computer:
1. Your computer should have Jupyterlab or Jupiter Notebook installed. If not, install either of those two.
2. Install Julia.
3. Install Julia packages - Random, Plots, Statistics, Distributions.
4. Install the Julia kernel for Jupyter Notebook. Requires installation of IJulia package.

Download the following notebooks from this repository and run locally on your computer: coin_toss.ipynb, transcription_coin_toss.ipynb and transcription_poisson.ipynb.
