# Workshop on Stochastic Processes in Biology, ICSB 2024, IIT Bombay
This repository has the Julia codes for the workshop "Stochastic Processes in Biology â€“ an Introductory Course".
We use Jupyter Notebook. You can run these codes two ways - a) on your computer or b) on Google Colab. 

A. To run simulations on your computer:
1. Your computer should have Jupyterlab or Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, install either of those two.
2. Install Julia.
3. Install Julia packages - Random, Plots, Statistics, Distributions.
4. Install the Julia kernel for Jupyter Notebook. Requires installation of IJulia package.

Download the following notebooks from this repository and run locally on your computer: coin_toss.ipynb, transcription_coin_toss.ipynb and transcription_poisson.ipynb.

B. To run simulations on Google Colab:
1. You need a Google account.
2. Download the notebooks starting with 'colab' from this repository: colab_coin_toss_julia.ipynb, colab_transcription_coin_toss_julia.ipynb, and colab_transcription_poisson_julia.ipynb.
3. Open Google [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Log in with your Google account. Upload these notebooks (names starting with colab) on Colab. Colab opens a pop-up to open notebooks. Choose the upload option and upload the file. Otherwise, to upload: File > Upload Notebook. Once the file opens on Colab, follow the instructions given on the file (steps 2 and 3). This uploaded file will be saved in the Colab Notebooks folder of your Google Drive.
4. Open a notebook on Colab. Follow the instructions given in the notebooks. Note that installation of Julia and its packages in your Colab run times may take minutes (maybe even 10 minutes).
